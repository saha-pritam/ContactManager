               <p class="mt-6 text-base font-medium leading-8 text-gray-600">I'm excited to share that I've been working on a
                  project that closely resembles the functionality of Google Contacts. While there might be a few features
                  missing currently, rest assured that I have plans to incorporate them in future updates.
               </p>
               <p class="mt-6 text-base font-medium leading-8 text-gray-600">For the tech enthusiasts out there, the backbone
                  of this project is crafted using Java, with the assistance of Spring Boot for a robust framework. Thymeleaf
                  takes care of the templating on the server side, ensuring seamless HTML rendering. The data is stored and
                  managed using MySQL, while the front-end is a blend of HTML, CSS, and the power of Tailwind CSS for a sleek
                  design. JavaScript, with a sprinkle of jQuery, adds that extra touch of interactivity to the user interface.
               </p>
               <p class="mt-6 text-base font-medium leading-8 text-gray-600">Now, the exciting part, I invite you to take
                  this project for a spin! Your valuable testing and feedback can help me iron out any kinks and make this
                  project even better. If you come across any suggestions or ideas during your exploration, don't hesitate to
                  drop me an email at saha.pritam.work@gmail.com. I'm eager to hear your thoughts and continuously improve
                  this project.
               </p>
               <p class="mt-6 text-base font-medium leading-8 text-gray-600">Thank you in advance for your time and
                  collaboration!
               </p>
               <p class="mt-6 text-base font-medium leading-8 text-gray-600">It's,<br>Pritam Saha</p>
